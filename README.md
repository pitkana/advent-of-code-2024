# advent-of-code-2024
A repository for my solutions to the puzzles in Advent of Code 2024, (hopefully) all done in Rust.

## Project structure
The input data for the problems is stored in the input directory. The scripts for each problem are stored in the main/src directory, named day1.rs, day2.rs, etc. for each day's problem.

### Day 1
Notes on the solution for day 1 will be added here.
